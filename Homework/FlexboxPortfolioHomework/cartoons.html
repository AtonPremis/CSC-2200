                    <p class="cartoon-text">
                        My favorite cartoon of the bunch, SlugTerra was my childhood cartoon. It has a unique
                        power system in there is some slugs in the world of SlugTerra that has locked
                        superpowers. The only way to unlock their superpowers is for them to travel very
                        fast, and that is done using specialized guns, called blasters. Not only is the
                        power system new, the characters are also written well. It does have some stereotype
                        characters, like the big and muscular man, old and goofy person, and a smart and
                        rational female. But, the chemistry between all these characters is really well done
                        and feels like their family. For a cartoon, it has some really mature villains in it.
                        Not all villains are evil just to be evil but actually has backstory and why they became
                        who they are. Overall, all these qualities and some more made it my favorite cartoon.

                    <h3 class="cartoon-title">My Little Pony</h3>
                    <p class="cartoon-text">
                        I know this is a pretty girlish cartoon especially to watch for a boy like me,
                        but let me tell you, it is an awesome cartoon. I'll give an example of one of my
                        favorite scenes in the cartoon. To start, Rainbow Dash, a pony with a dream of becoming
                        the fastest pegasus, enters a race to decide the fastest pegasus. Things starts off simple,
                        her and all other competitors are racing. But then, one of the racers got into a collision
                        and is falling down from a very great height. Rainbow Dash sees this and has to decide,
                        whether to try and save the racer or to continue with the race. Of course, she decides
                        to try to save the racer. But, she isn't able to catch up fast enough. All hope seems
                        to be lost, but then, Rainbow Dash breaks the sound barrier, with awesome rainbow trails
                        behind her. She saves the racer, but lost the race in the process. While she has lost,
                        people still cheer for her and have achieved something greater than her dream.

                    <h3 class="cartoon-title">Wild Kratts</h3>
                    <p class="cartoon-text">
                        Wild Kratts follows the adventure of two brothers, Chris and Martin. There isn't a main
                        villain, or at least I don't remember it, but each episode, there is a threat to
                        the brothers. In order to overcome the threats, the brothers has to collect animal's
                        DNA, and use the DNA to transform into that animal. When doing this, the brothers
                        gets special attributes and abilities pertaining to the selected animal. Each episode's
                        plot and story and always interesting, and the brothers has to use new animal powers
                        to overcome the new threat, as using old powers don't always work. This cartoon also
                        does a great job at informing the audience what the animals do and have in their
                        toolbox to survive the wild. Personally, I got hooked into the cartoon because of
                        the variety of animals and situations the characters were put in.
