        <p>Hi, I am a Freshman at AU. I plan to double major in <span class="emphasis">CS and Cybersecurity</span>. An interesting fact about
            me was that I was born in Malaysia and my parents moved to Illinois in 2009. Some things I like to do
            is playing video games, attending and doing events, program in my free time, and eating.

        <p>I like this <a href="https://wlay.me/Skribblio-Word-Bank/">website</a> because it lets me cheat on a game called
            <i>skribbl.io</i>.
